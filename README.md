# Temperature regulated PWM Fan Control with ATTiny 45/85
This is a simple circuit to drive an 4-Pin PWM Fan using an ATtiny 45. With an Arduino Uno the first code was running after 30 minutes, but I would like to use a very small circuit in my gaming PC, so I tried to adopt it to some left over ATTinys. It was not as easy as I thought, because fast PWM on ATtiny needs special setup of some registers. The best description I found was on this website, which sets the PWM to 32 kHz which is a little bit higher than 25 kHz needed for the PWM of the Fan, but it worked with full duty cycle.

The seond challenge was that Arduiono analogread() did not work on the ATtiny at all. I found an alternative way on the following page:

https://github.com/arc12/AVR-Experiments-and-Examples/blob/master/ADC%20Tiny85/ADC%20Tiny85/ADC%20Tiny85.cpp

The NTC conversion/correction to Â°C from 10bit ADC was generated with this page:

The circuit and code should be self explanatory.
